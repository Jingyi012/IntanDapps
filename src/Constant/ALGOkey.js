1. algosdk: a high level sdk to interact with the algorand blockchain like generating wallet, 
build & sign transaction, query the blockchain for accounts balance, transaction history and more.(making)
2. algodClient: low level HTTP provide basic acc management, transaction submission, block retrievel 
and blockchain-related tasks. (manage)
3. indexerClient: similar to algodClient but the purpose of this tool is to adavance 
query and search blockchain data (query)
